## Objective<br/>
Vehicle Movement Patterns: The solution should be able to analyse the frequency and timing of
vehicle movement in and out of the campus. It should be able to identify peak times and patterns.<br;>
Parking Occupancy: The solution should be able to monitor the occupancy of parking lots in realtime. It should be able to identify which parking lots are frequently occupied and at what times.<br/>
Vehicle Matching: The solution should be able to match captured vehicle images and license plates
to an approved vehicle database. It should be able to identify unauthorized vehicles.<br/>
## Solutions<br/>
The system should be able to analyze the frequency and timing of vehicle movement in and out of a campus. It should be able to identify peak times and patterns of vehicle movement. This could be useful for improving traffic flow and security. The system should be able to monitor the occupancy of parking lots in real time. It should be able to identify which parking lots are frequently occupied and at what times. This could be useful for helping drivers find parking spots more easily. The system should be able to match captured vehicle images and license plates to an approved vehicle database. It should be able to identify unauthorized vehicles. This could be useful for security purposes.<br />
