## Features<br/>
### Vehicle Movement Patterns <br/>
Analysis of Frequency and Timing: The system analyzes the frequency and timing of vehicle movements in and out of the campus.<br/>
Peak Time Identification: It identifies peak times and movement patterns, providing valuable insights for traffic management.<br/>
### Parking Occupancy <br/>
Real-time Monitoring: The system monitors the occupancy of parking lots in real-time.<br/>
Frequent Occupancy Identification: It identifies which parking lots are frequently occupied and at what times, aiding in better parking space management.<br/>
### Vehicle Matching <br/>
Database Matching: Captured vehicle images and license plates are matched against an approved vehicle database.<br/>
Unauthorized Vehicle Identification: The system can identify unauthorized vehicles, enhancing campus security.<br/>
## Benefits<br/>
Improved Traffic Management: Helps in managing vehicle flow and reducing congestion by identifying peak times and patterns.<br/>
Enhanced Parking Management: Provides real-time occupancy data, aiding in efficient parking space allocation.<br/>
Increased Security: Matches vehicles against a database to identify unauthorized vehicles, improving campus safety.<br/>
## Technologies Used<br/>



## Solutions<br/>
The system should be able to analyze the frequency and timing of vehicle movement in and out of a campus. It should be able to identify peak times and patterns of vehicle movement. This could be useful for improving traffic flow and security. The system should be able to monitor the occupancy of parking lots in real time. It should be able to identify which parking lots are frequently occupied and at what times. This could be useful for helping drivers find parking spots more easily. The system should be able to match captured vehicle images and license plates to an approved vehicle database. It should be able to identify unauthorized vehicles. This could be useful for security purposes.<br />
